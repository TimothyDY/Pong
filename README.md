## Technical Details

- Backend: Flask + Flask-SocketIO
- Database: SQLAlchemy with SQLite (local development)
- Frontend: HTML5 Canvas + JavaScript
- Real-time: WebSocket connections via Socket.IO with eventlet
- Async Mode: eventlet for optimal WebSocket performance

## Troubleshooting Multiplayer Issues

If you're experiencing multiplayer connection problems:

1. Check WebSocket Connection: Look for the connection status indicator
2. Browser Console: Open dev tools (F12) and check errors
3. Test Connection:
   ```bash
   python test_websocket.py
   ```
4. Multiple Browsers: Try incognito or different browsers
5. Firewall: Ensure port 5000 is open
6. Eventlet: Use `python start.py`

## Testing Multiplayer

1. Start the server: `python start.py`
2. Open two browser tabs/windows
3. Register/login with different accounts
4. Create a PvP room in one tab
5. Join the room from the other tab
6. Both players should see each other and be able to start the game

## Database

- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- SQLite (development)

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `SECRET_KEY` | Flask secret key | `"secret!"` |
